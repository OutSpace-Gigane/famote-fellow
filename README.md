# Introduction
Auto-Python Project Creator for Beginners  
  
# How to Start
Just type this:
```  
python fatome-fellow.py  
```
It may help you if you're beginner coder.  
  
# Using the Script:
## Choosing a Path
If you have a "vaild" path already just type or copy paste this. {SKIP that if you want to}  

## Naming Project
It's necessary but you can name the project with anything. it's not hard to change the folder in future  

## Templates
Choosing a Template would look like hard so there's 2 Options.
1. Basic: Creates a file that has "Hello World!" for output  
2. Manual: You can edit the Options manually (you can only import the modules tho... More Options should be added in next updates)  

(!!! MORE TEMPLATES SHOULD BE ADDED IN NEXT UPDATES !!!)

# Important Notes:
- It just creates a template NOT the code
